# StackC
## Problem
Implementing a stack in pure C with features such as being polymorphic, generic and dynamically allocating.

## Solution
'struct' and functions replicate features of class and methods. Constructor function takes in size of data type to be used for the elements.
Space for elements are manually allocated in the heap using 'malloc()'. void * pointers are used to accept elements of any data type.

## Outputs
Tested stack with primitive data types and functions as intended.
